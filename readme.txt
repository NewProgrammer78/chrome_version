this program outputs the google chrome version to the commandline by using something called a subprocess in python

step 1: cd ("file path to chrome_VR.py") - delete asterisks and parenthesis, but do not include the file itself in path
step 2: python chrome_VR.py

this should show an output close to:
Version=121.0.6167.140

your output will change due to a difference of google chrome version.
